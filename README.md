# About this Repository

Copyright (c) Igor Gre≈°ovnik

This repository is part of the Investigative Generic Library (*IGLib*). It contains some *PowerShell* utility scripts that are used in IGLib and wider. This repository (the _IGLibScriptPS_) is a fork of the *upstream* repository *IGLibScript*, in which scripts other than PowerShell are removed. Normally, no development would be done in this repository, just the necessary deletions are made or edits to readme or license files. The repository is updated by merging the *master* branch from the upstream repository.

Main branch of the _IGLibScript_ repository: *master*
